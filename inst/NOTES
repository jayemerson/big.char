Errata addressed from testing of STAT 662 class.  This probably
wasn't updated and many/most of these would have been fixed?
Some things are notes of what was done (rather than a TODO).
###############################################################

big.char(0, 3) should be trapped properly.

Now issue warning if init=NULL because no initialization might be risky.

init=NA wasn't working; fixed so it actually initializes with NA.

Simplified big.char() code; checking is.null(y) wasn't necessary.

Allow init to be overly long, simply truncate for consistency.
# This was definitely not changed (April 2015)

Added extra signatures for blocking big.matrix inheritance, taking a
small step closer to ultimate intended usage.  Some things are still
allowed for debugging purposes only.
